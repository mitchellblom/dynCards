# Dynamic Cards

(Dear self, Create Template for this and future Readmes before completing this one)

PLAN:

<!-- 1. Create an HTML page that contains a text area and a button labeled Create. -->



<!-- 2. When the user enters in text into the text area and then clicks the create button, create a new card element in the DOM. You decide the height/width of the card. -->

	a. 

3. When the user clicks the Delete button, the containing card, and no other cards, should then be removed from the DOM. Not just made invisible, actually removed from the DOM.
